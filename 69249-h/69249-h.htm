      <div class='line'>I remember, well remember,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That dark and dreadful day,</div>
      <div class='line'>When they whispered to me, “Chloe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Your children’s sold away!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It seemed as if a bullet</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Had shot me through and through,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I felt as if my heart-strings</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Was breaking right in two.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And I says to cousin Milly,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“There must be some mistake;</div>
      <div class='line'>Where’s Mistus?” “In the great house crying—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Crying like her heart would break.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And the lawyer’s there with Mistus;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Says he’s come to ’ministrate,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Cause when master died he just left</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Heap of debt on the estate.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“And I thought ’twould do you good</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To bid your boys good-bye—</div>
      <div class='line'>To kiss them both and shake their hands,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And have a hearty cry.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! Chloe, I knows how you feel,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Cause I’se been through it all;</div>
      <div class='line'>I thought my poor old heart would break,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When master sold my Saul.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Just then I heard the footsteps</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of my children at the door,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I rose right up to meet them,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But I fell upon the floor.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And I heard poor Jakey saying,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh, mammy, don’t you cry!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And I felt my children kiss me</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And bid me, both, good-bye.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then I had a mighty sorrow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Though I nursed it all alone;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I wasted to a shadow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And turned to skin and bone.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But one day dear Uncle Jacob</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(In heaven he’s now a saint)</div>
      <div class='line'>Said, “Your poor heart is in the fire,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But child you must not faint.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Then I said to Uncle Jacob,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If I was good like you,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the heavy trouble dashed me</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I’d know just what to do.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then he said to me, “Poor Chloe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The way is open wide:”</div>
      <div class='line'>And he told me of the Saviour,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the fountain in His side.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then he said “Just take your burden</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To the blessed Master’s feet;</div>
      <div class='line'>I takes all my troubles, Chloe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Right unto the mercy-seat.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His words waked up my courage,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And I began to pray,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I felt my heavy burden</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Rolling like a stone away.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And a something seemed to tell me,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>You will see your boys again—</div>
      <div class='line'>And that hope was like a poultice</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Spread upon a dreadful pain.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And it often seemed to whisper,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Chloe, trust and never fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll get justice in the kingdom,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If you do not get it here.</div>

      <div class='line'>Master only left old Mistus</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One bright and handsome boy;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she fairly doted on him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He was her pride and joy.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We all liked Mister Thomas,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He was so kind at heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when the young folks got in scrapes,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He always took their part.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He kept right on that very way</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Till he got big and tall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And old Mistus used to chide him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And say he’d spile us all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But somehow the farm did prosper</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When he took things in hand;</div>
      <div class='line'>And though all the servants liked him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He made them understand.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>One evening Mister Thomas said,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Just bring my easy shoes:</div>
      <div class='line'>I am going to sit by mother,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And read her up the news.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Soon I heard him tell old Mistus</div>

      <div class='line in2'>We’ll whip them sure as night!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then I saw old Mistus tremble;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She gasped and held her breath;</div>
      <div class='line'>And she looked on Mister Thomas</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With a face as pale as death.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They are firing on Fort Sumpter;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oh! I wish that I was there!—</div>
      <div class='line'>Why, dear mother! what’s the matter?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>You’re the picture of despair.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I was thinking, dearest Thomas,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Twould break my very heart</div>
      <div class='line'>If a fierce and dreadful battle</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“None but cowards, dearest mother,</div>

      <div class='line'>When the tyrant’s hand is shaking,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All the heart is holding dear.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I felt sorry for old Mistus;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She got too full to speak;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I saw the great big tear-drops</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A running down her cheek.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Mister Thomas too was troubled</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With choosing on that night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt staying with his mother</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And joining in the fight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Soon down into the village came</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A call for volunteers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mistus gave up Mister Thomas,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With many sighs and tears.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His uniform was real handsome;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He looked so brave and strong;</div>
      <div class='line'>But somehow I couldn’t help thinking</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His fighting must be wrong.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Though the house was very lonesome,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I thought ’twould all come right,</div>
      <div class='line'>For I felt somehow or other</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We was mixed up in that fight.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And I said to Uncle Jacob,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Now old Mistus feels the sting,</div>
      <div class='line'>For this parting with your children</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is a mighty dreadful thing.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Never mind,” said Uncle Jacob,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Just wait and watch and pray,</div>
      <div class='line'>For I feel right sure and certain,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Slavery’s bound to pass away;</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Because I asked the Spirit,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And something reasoned right inside,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And his dear old eyes would brighten,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mistus prayed up in the parlor,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That the Secesh all might win;</div>
      <div class='line'>We were praying in the cabins,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wanting freedom to begin.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mister Thomas wrote to Mistus,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Telling ’bout the Bull’s Run fight,</div>

    <div>BY MRS. FRANCES E. W. HARPER.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c009'>Shalmanezer, Prince of Cosman, stood on the threshold
of manly life, having just received a rich inheritance
which had been left him by his father.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a magnificent-looking creature—the very
incarnation of manly strength and beauty. The
splendid poise of his limbs, the vigor and litheness of
his motions, the glorious light that flashed from his
splendid dark eyes, the bright joyous smiles that
occasionally wreathed his fresh young lips, and the
finely-erect carriage of his head, were enough to impress
the beholder with the thought, “Here is an
athlete armed for a glorious strife!”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Shalmanezer was thinking upon his rich inheritance
and how he should use it, he suddenly lifted
his eyes and saw two strange-looking personages
standing near him. They both advanced towards
Shalmanezer when they saw their presence had attracted
his attention.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The first one that approached the young man and
addressed him, was named Desire. He was a pleasant-looking
youth, with a flushed face, and eager,
restless eyes. He looked as if he had been pursuing
a journey, or had been grasping at an object he had
failed to obtain. There was something in his manner
that betrayed a want of rest—a look in his eyes
which seemed to say, “I am not satisfied.” But when
he approached, he smiled in the most seductive manner,
and, reaching out his hand to Shalmanezer said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have come to welcome thee to man’s estate, and
for thy enjoyment, I have brought thee three friends
who will lead thee into the brightest paths, and press
to thy lips the sweetest elixirs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gladly the young man received the greeting of
Desire, who immediately introduced his three companions,
whose names were, Pleasure, Wealth, and
Fame.—Pleasure was a most beautiful creature. Her
lovely dark eyes flashed out a laughing light; upon
her finely-carved lips hovered the brightest and sweetest
smiles, which seemed ever ready to break into
merry ripples of laughter; her robe was magnificently
beautiful, as if it had imprisoned in its warp and
woof the beauty of the rainbow and the glory of the
setting sun; in her hand she held a richly wrought
chalice in which sparkled and effervesced a ruby-colored
liquid which was as beautiful to the eye as it
was pleasant to the taste. When Pleasure was presented
to Shalmanezer, she held out to him her cup
and said in the sweetest tones:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Come, drink of my cup, it is sparkling and bright</div>
      <div class='line'>As rubies distilled in the morning light;</div>
      <div class='line'>A truce to sorrow and adieu to pain—</div>
      <div class='line'>Here’s the cup to strengthen, soothe and sustain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Just as Shalmanezer was about to grasp the cup,
the other personage approached him. Her name was
Peace, and she was attended by a mild, earnest-looking
young man called Self-Denial. In the calm
depths of her dark-blue eyes was a tender, loving
light, and on her brow a majestic serenity which
seemed to say, “The cares of earth are at my feet;
in vain its tempests sweep around my path.” There
was also a look of calm, grand patience on the brow
of her attendant, which gave him the aspect of one
who had passed through suffering unto Peace. Shalmanezer
was gazing eagerly on the fair young face of
Pleasure, and about to quaff the sparkling nectar,
when Peace suddenly arrested his hand and exclaimed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Beware of this cup! ’Neath its ruddy glow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is an undercurrent of shame and woe;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Neath its sparkling sheen so fair and bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are serpents that hiss, and adders that bite.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The young man paused a moment, looked on the
plain garb of Peace and then on the enchanting loveliness
of Pleasure, and, pushing aside the hand of
Peace with a scornful gesture, he said proudly and defiantly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will follow Pleasure!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Peace, thus repulsed, turned sadly away; and Self-Denial,
wounded by Shalmanezer’s rude rejection,
bowed his head in silent sorrow and disappeared from
the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Peace departed, Shalmanezer eagerly grasped
the cup of Pleasure and pressed it to his lips, while
she clasped her hand in his and said in a most
charming manner, “Follow me;” and then he went
willingly to the place where she dwelt.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Shalmanezer approached the palace of Pleasure
he heard the sweetest music rising on the air in
magnificent swells or sinking in ravishing cadences;
at his feet were springing the brightest and fairest
flowers; the sweetest perfumes were bathing the air
with the most exquisite fragrance; beautiful girls
moved like visions of loveliness through the
mazy dance; rare old wines sparkled on the festal
board; the richest viands and most luscious fruits
tempted the taste; and laughter, dance and song
filled the air with varied delights. For a while Shalmanezer
was enraptured with the palace of Pleasure.
But soon he became weary of its gay confusion. The
merry ripples of laughter lost their glad freshness;
the once delightful music seemed to faint into strange
monotones—whether the defect was in his ear or in
the music he could not tell, but somehow it had ceased
to gratify him; the constant flow of merry talk
grew strangely distasteful to him; the pleasant viands
began to pall upon his taste; at times he thought
he detected a bitterness in the rare old wines which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Pleasure ever and anon presented to his lips, and he
turned wearily away from everything that had pleased
his taste or had charmed and entranced his senses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shalmanezer sat moodily wishing that Desire would
return and bring with him another attendant to whom
he had been introduced when he had first clasped
hands with Pleasure, and whose name was Wealth.
While he was musing, he lifted up his eyes and saw
Wealth and Desire standing at the door of his Boudoir,
and near them he saw the sweet loving face of
Peace, who was attended by Self-Denial. Peace was
about to approach him, but he repulsed her with an
impatient frown, and turning to Desire he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have grown weary of Pleasure, and I wish to
be introduced to the halls of Wealth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Taller, graver and less fair was Wealth, than her
younger sister, Pleasure. If the beauty of Pleasure
could be compared to the vernal freshness of Spring—that
of Wealth suggested the maturity of golden
harvests, and ripe autumnal fruits. Like Pleasure,
she was very richly attired; a magnificent velvet robe
fell in graceful folds around her well-proportioned
form; like prisms of captured light, the most beautiful
jewels gleamed and flashed in her hair; a girdle
of the finest and most exquisitely wrought gold was
clasped around her waist; her necklace and bracelets
were formed of the purest jewels and finest diamonds.—But
there was something in her face which betokened
a want which all her wealth could not supply.
There was a mournful restlessness in her eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>that at times seemed to border on the deepest sadness;
and yet, there was something so alluring in her
manner, so dazzling in her attire, and fascinating in
her surroundings, that men would often sacrifice
time, talent, energy, and even conscience and manhood,
to secure her smiles and bask in her favor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shalmanezer,” said Desire to Wealth, “has grown
weary of thy sister, Pleasure, and would fain dwell
in thy stately halls. Is there aught to hinder him
from being one of thy favored guests?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing at all,” said Wealth, smiling. “The rich
inheritance left him by his father has been increasing
in value, and I am glad that he was too wise to
throw in Pleasure’s cup life’s richest gifts away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words she reached out her jewelled
hand to Shalmanezer and said, “Follow me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Weary of the halls of Pleasure, Shalmanezer gladly
rose to follow Wealth. As he was leaving, he paused
a moment to bid adieu to Pleasure. But she was
so changed, that he did not recognize in the faded
woman with the weary, listless manner, dull eyes
and hollow cheeks, the enchanting girl, who, a few
years before, had led him to her halls a welcome and
delighted guest. All was so changed. It seemed
more like a dream than a reality, that he had dwelt
for years in what now seemed like a disenchanted
palace. The banquet table was strewn with broken
and tasteless fragments; the flowers had lost their
fragrance and beauty, and lay in piles of scentless
leaves; the soft sweet music had fainted into low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>breathed sighs, and silence reigned in the deserted
halls where dance and revelry and song had wreathed
with careless mirth the bright and fleeting hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come,” said Wealth, “my Chariot waits thee at
the door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without one pang of regret, Shalmanezer turned
from the halls of Pleasure, to ride with Wealth in
her magnificent chariot.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they drove along, Wealth showed Shalmanezer
the smoke rising from a thousand factories. Pausing
a moment, she said:—“I superintend these works
and here are my subjects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Shalmanezer gazed on the colossal piles of brick
and mortar, as those castles of industry met his eye.
Just then the bell rang, and he saw issuing from
amid the smoke and whir of machinery a sight that
filled his soul with deep compassion.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were pale, sad-looking women wending
their way home to snatch some moment’s rest, and
an humble meal before returning to their tasks.
There were weary-looking men, who seemed to be
degenerating in mental strength and physical vigor.
There were young children who looked as if the
warm fresh currents of life in their veins had been
touched with premature decay. And saddest of all—he
saw young girls who looked as if they were
rapidly changing from unsophisticated girlhood into
over-ripe womanhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are these thy servants?” said Shalmanezer, sadly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These,” said Wealth, “are my servants, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>my favorites. In dark mines—close factories—beneath
low roofed huts—they dig the glittering jewels,
and weave the webs of splendor and beauty with
which I adorn my favorites. But I see that the sight
pains thee. Let us pass on to fairer scenes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bending down to her finely-liveried coachman, she
whispered in his ear, and in a few minutes the factories,
with their smoke and din, were left behind.
Beautiful lawns, lovely parks, and elegant residences
rose before the pleased eyes of Shalmanezer;
beautiful children sported on the lawns; lovely girls
roamed in the parks; and the whole scene was a
bright contrast to those he had left behind.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length they rode up an avenue of stately trees,
and stopped at the home of Wealth. “Here is my
dwelling,” she said, “enter and be my welcome
guest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Shalmanezer accepted the invitation, and entering,
gazed with delighted wonder on the splendor and
beauty of the place. On the walls hung most beautiful
pictures surrounded by the richest frames—rare
creations of the grand old masters; lovely statues
suggested the idea of life strangely imprisoned in
marble; velvet carpets sank pleasantly beneath his
tread; elegant book cases, inlaid with ivory and
pearl, held on the shelves the grand and noble productions
of the monarchs of mind who still rule
from their graves in the wide realms of thought and
imagination. In her halls were sumptuous halls for
feasting; delightful alcoves for thought and meditation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>lovely little boudoirs for cozy chats with cherished
friends. Even religion found costly bibles and
splendidly embossed prayer books in the chambers of
repose, where beneath the softened light of golden
lamps, the children of Wealth sank to rest on beds
of down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely,” said Shalmanezer, “he must be a strangely
restless creature, who cannot be satisfied in this
home of beauty, grace and affluence.” And yet,
while he spake, he was conscious of a sense of unrest.
He tried to shake it off, but still it would return.
He would find himself sighing amid the fairest
scenes—oppressed with a sense of longing for something
he could not define. His eye was not satisfied
with seeing, nor his ear with hearing. It seemed as
if life had been presented to him as a luscious fruit,
and he had eagerly extracted its richest juices, and
was ready to throw away the bitter rind in hopeless
disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>While he sat gloomily surveying the past, and feeling
within his soul a hunger which neither
Wealth nor Pleasure could appease, he lifted his
eyes towards a distant mountain whose summit was
crowned with perpetual snows, although a thousand
sunbeams warmed and cheered the vale below. As
he gazed, he saw a youth with a proud gait, buoyant
step and flashing eye, climbing the mount. In his
hand he held a beautifully embossed card, on which
was written an invitation from Fame to climb her almost
inaccessible heights and hear the sweetest music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>that ever ravished mortal ear. As the youth ascended
the mount, Shalmanezer heard the shouts of
applause which were wafted to the ears of the
young man, who continued to climb with unabated
ardor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here,” said Shalmanezer, “is a task worthy of
my powers. I have wasted much of my time in the
halls of Pleasure; I have grown weary of the stately
palaces of Wealth; I will go forth and climb the
heights of Fame, and find a welcome in the sun-crowned
palaces of Renown. O, the sight of that
young man inspires my soul, and gives new tone
and vigor to my life. I will not pause another moment
to listen to the blandishments of Wealth. Instead
of treading on these soft carpets, I will brace
my soul to climb the rugged heights to gaze upon the
fair face of Fame.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as he was making this resolve, he saw Peace
and her attendant gazing anxiously and silently upon
him. His face flushed with sudden anger; a wrathful
light flashed from his eyes; and turning his face
coldly from Peace, he said: “I do wish Peace would
come without her unwelcome companion—Self-Denial
I do utterly and bitterly hate.” Peace again repulsed,
turned sadly away, followed by Self-Denial.
With eager haste Shalmanezer rose up and left the
bowers of Ease and halls of Pride, to tread the rugged
heights of Fame, with patient, ready feet. As he
passed upward, new vigor braced his nerves. He felt
an exhilaration of spirits he had never enjoyed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>halls of Wealth or bowers of Pleasure. Onward and
upward he proudly moved, as the multitude, who
stood at the base, cheered him with rapturous applause,
and no music was ever so sweet to his ear as
the plaudits of the crowd; but, as he ascended higher
and higher, the voices of the multitude grew
fainter and fainter; some voices that cheered him at
the beginning of his journey had melted into the
stillness of death; others had harshened into the
rough tones of disapprobation; others were vociferously
applauding a new aspirant who had since started
to climb the summit of Renown; but, with his eye
upon the palace of Fame, he still climbed on, while
the air grew rarer, and the atmosphere colder. The
old elasticity departed from his limbs, and the buoyancy
from his spirits, and it seemed as if the chills of
death were slowly creeping around his heart. But
still, with fainter step he kept climbing upward, until
almost exhausted, he sank down at the palace-gate
of Fame, exclaiming, “Is this all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Very stately and grand was the cloud-capped palace
of Fame. The pillars of her lofty abode were
engraven with the names of successful generals,
mighty conquerors, great leaders, grand poets, illustrious
men and celebrated women. There were
statues on which the tooth of Time was slowly
gnawing; the statues of men whose brows had once
been surrounded by a halo of glory, but were now
darkened by the shadow of their crimes. Those
heights which had seemed so enchanting at a distance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>now seemed more like barren mounds, around
which the chills of Death were ever sweeping.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fame heard the voice of her votary, and came out
to place upon his brow her greenest bays and brightest
laurels, and bid him welcome to her palace; but
when she saw the deathly whiteness of his face, she
shrank back in pity and fear. The light was fading
from his eye; his limbs had lost their manly strength;
and Fame feared that the torpor of Death would
overtake him before she could crown him as her honored
guest. She bent down her ear to the sufferer,
and heard him whisper slowly, “Peace! Peace!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then said Fame to her servants, “Descend to the
vale, bring the best medical skill ye can find, and
search for Peace, and entreat her to come; tell her
that one of my votaries lies near to death, and longs
for her presence.” The servants descended to the
vale, and soon returned, bringing with them a celebrated
physician.—Peace had heard the cry of Shalmanezer,
and had entered the room with her companion
before the doctor had come. When the physician
saw Shalmanezer, he gazed anxiously upon him, felt
the fluttering pulse, and chafed the pale cold hands to
restore the warmth and circulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, Pleasure and Wealth having
heard the story of Shalmanezer’s illness, entered the
room. “There is but one thing,” said the physician,
“can save Shalmanezer’s life: some one must take
the warm healthy blood from his veins and inject it
into Shalmanezer’s veins before he can be restored to
health.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Pleasure and Wealth looked aghast when they
heard the doctor’s prescription. Pleasure suddenly
remembered that she had a pressing engagement;
Wealth said “I am no longer young, nor even well,
and am sure I have not one drop of blood to spare;”
Fame pitied her faithful votary, but amid the cold
blasts that swept around her home, was sure it would
be very imprudent for her to attempt to part with so
much blood. Just as Pleasure, Wealth and Fame had
refused to give the needed aid, Desire entered the
room, but when he heard the conditions for the restoration
of Shalmanezer, shrank back in selfish dismay,
and refused also.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Shalmanezer lay gasping for breath, and looking
wistfully at his old companions, Peace, attended by
Self-Denial, drew near the sick man’s couch. Shalmanezer
opened his eyes languidly, and closed them
wearily; when life was like a joyous dream, he had
repulsed Peace and utterly hated Self-Denial, and
what could he dare hope from either in his hour of
dire extremity. While he lay with his eyes half-closed,
Self-Denial approached the bedside, and baring
his arm, said to the doctor:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here is thy needed remedy. Take the blood
from these veins, and with it restore Shalmanezer to
health and strength.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor struck his lancet into Self-Denial’s arm,
and drawing from it the needed quantity of blood, injected
it into Shalmanezer’s veins. The remedy was
effectual. Health flushed the cheeks of Shalmanezer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and braced each nerve with new vigor, and he soon
recovered from his fearful exhaustion. Then his
heart did cleave unto Self-Denial. He had won his
heart by his lofty sacrifice. He had bought his love
by the blood from his own veins. Clasping hands
with Self-Denial, he trod with him the paths of Peace,
and in so doing, received an amount of true happiness
which neither Pleasure, Wealth nor Fame could
give.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
